       </h2>

       <ul>
        <li>We'll use Google Maps to map out and show you the walking distance around your position, <br>
             and where the best route is for you to walk! The app will notify you when the distance to your destination is walkable. <br> 
             The choice is yours!</li>

the car wonâ€™t start. (farfetched)*/-->
