           How we do this:
       </h2>

        <p>We'll use Google Maps to map out and show you the walking distance around your position, <br>
             and where the best route is for you to walk! The app will notify you when the distance to your destination is walkable. <br> 
             The choice is yours!</p>

<!--*Add an app/device to cars, where whenever they start it, 
if they choose a destination within walking distance, 
like two-mile circle around the designated home, 
the car wonâ€™t start. (farfetched)*/-->
